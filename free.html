        <h3>why use java?</h3><p>The name JAVA is a computer-based programming language that functions to develop computer-based applications. <br>
            It does not have a specific full form or neither an abbreviation. Hence, the 'Just Another Virtual Accelerator' <br>
            is a fictionalized complete version of JAVA and the name is put forward by the general public. <br>
            Tasks commonly performed with Java <br>
            <li>Building and running mobile applications.</li>
            <li>Building and scaling cloud applications.</li>
            <li>Developing chatbots and other marketing tools.</li>
            <li>Powering enterprise-level web applications.</li>
            <li>Supporting artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) devices.</li><br>
            <p>A Java program may conation more than one class definition. We use the class keyword to define the class. The class is a <br>
            blueprint of a Java program. It contains information about user-defined methods, variables, and constants. <br>
            Every Java program has at least one class that contains the main() method. <br>
            Data Structure in java is defined as the collection of data pieces that offers an effective means of storing and <br>
            organising data in a computer. Linked List, Stack, Queue, and arrays are a few examples of java data structures. <br><br><br>

            <img src="ht.jpg" class="course">
            <h3>what is HTML?</h3><p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be <br>
                structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. <br>
                HTML is not a programming language. It's a markup language. In fact, that is the technology's name: HyperText Markup Language. <br>
                There are three categories of HTML: transitional, strict, and frameset. Transitional is the most common type of HTML while the strict <br>
                type of HTML is meant to return rules to HTML and make it more reliable. Frameset allows Web developers to create a mosaic <br>
                of HTML documents and a menu system. <br>
                The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. <br>
                The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999. Another version, <br>
                XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. <br>
                What are the 4 basic HTML tags? <br>
                Basic HTML Tags There is a range of HTML tags, they help you to design your web page. There are four required tags in HTML. <br>
                These are html, title, head and body. <br> <br>
            </p>

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <img src="cs.jpg" class="course">
             <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
             <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents. <br>
                These pages contain information on how to learn and use CSS and on available software. <br>
                CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular <br>
                elements or groups of elements on your web page. In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. <br>
                This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. <br><br>
                The CSS selectors module defines the patterns to select elements to which a set of CSS rules are then <br>
                applied along with their specificity . The CSS selectors module provides us with more than 60 selectors and <br>
                five combinators. Other modules provide additional pseudo-class selectors and pseudo-elements.<br><br>
                <p class="para">What is the basic syntax of CSS?</p> <br><p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.<br>
                The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a <br>
                CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. <br> <br></p>
                <p class="para">What are the 2 main parts of a CSS syntax?</p><br>
                <p>A CSS rule consists of two main parts: selector ('h1') and declaration ('color: red'). In HTML, element names <br>
                are case-insensitive so 'h1' works just as well as 'H1'. The declaration has two parts: property name ('color') <br>
                and property value ('red'). <br><br></p>

                    <p>How CSS is structured - Learn web development <br>
                    At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components: Properties: These are human-readable <br>
                    identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. <br>
                    For example, font-size , width , background-color . Values: Each property is assigned a value. <br><br><br>

            <p>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. <br>
                Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as accountants and <br>
                scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances. <br>
                Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, <br>
                functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type <br>
                checking of the source code. <br>
                Python is a popular language for web and software development because you can create complex, multi-protocol <br>
                applications while maintaining concise, readable syntax. In fact, some of the most popular applications were built with Python <br></p>

                behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. <br>
                It is one of the most versatile languages for building rich and dynamic websites. JavaScript is typically used for <br>
                front-end web development, but it can also be used for backend development. <br>
                JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. <br>
                After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. <br>
                In order to start coding in JavaScript the next step is to open up the actual place where we will write and execute the code <br>
                inside the Chrome browser. From the top menu, Go to: Menu, then Developer, and then click on JavaScript Console. You can also <br>

            <h2>data science</h2>
            <img src="ds.jpg" class="course">
            <h3>what is data science?</h3>
            <p>Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary <br>
                approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, <br>
                artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. <br>
                What is data science used for? <br>
                Data science is used to study data in four main ways: <br><br>

                1. Descriptive analysis <br>
                Descriptive analysis examines data to gain insights into what happened or what is happening in the data environment. <br>
                It is characterized by data visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives. <br>
                For example, a flight booking service may record data like the number of tickets booked each day. <br>
                Descriptive analysis will reveal booking spikes, booking slumps, and high-performing months for this service. <br><br>
                
                2. Diagnostic analysis <br>
                Diagnostic analysis is a deep-dive or detailed data examination to understand why something happened. <br>
                It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations. <br>
                Multiple data operations and transformations may be performed on a given data set to discover <br>
                unique patterns in each of these techniques.For example, the flight service might drill down on a particularly <br>
                high-performing month to better understand the booking spike. This may lead to the discovery that many customers <br>
                visit a particular city to attend a monthly sporting event. <br><br>
                
                3. Predictive analysis <br>
                Predictive analysis uses historical data to make accurate forecasts about data patterns that may occur in the future. <br>
                It is characterized by techniques such as machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. <br>
                In each of these techniques, computers are trained to reverse engineer causality connections in the data.For example, <br>
                the flight service team might use data science to predict flight booking patterns for the coming year at the start of each year. <br>
                The computer program or algorithm may look at past data and predict booking spikes for certain destinations in May. <br>
                Having anticipated their customer’s future travel requirements, the company could start targeted advertising from February. <br><br>
                
                4. Prescriptive analysis <br>
                Prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next level. It not only predicts what is likely to happen but also suggests <br>
                an optimum response to that outcome. It can analyze the potential implications of different choices and recommend the best course of action. <br>
                It uses graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and recommendation engines from machine learning. <br><br><br><br>
