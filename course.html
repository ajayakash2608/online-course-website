         <p><h3>What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</h3>
            Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, <br>
            especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, <br>
            natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. <br> <br>
            
            <p class="para">How does AI work?</p> <br>

            As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote <br>
            how their products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a <br>
            component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized <br>
            hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming <br>
            language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers. <br>
            
            In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data <br>
            for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. <br>
            In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, <br>
            or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions <br>
            of examples. New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, images, <br>
            music and other media. <br>
            
            AI programming focuses on cognitive skills that include the following: <br>
            
            Learning. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for <br>
            how to turn it into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, <br>
            provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task. <br>
            Reasoning. This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome. <br>
            Self-correction. This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure <br>
            they provide the most accurate results possible. <br>
            Creativity. This aspect of AI uses neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods and <br>
            other AI techniques to generate new images, new text, new music and new ideas Differences between AI, <br>
             machine learning and deep learning. <br><br><br>

            <p><h3>What Is an Algorithm?</h3>
                An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. One common <br>
                example of an algorithm is a recipe, which consists of specific instructions for preparing a dish or meal. <br>
                Every computerized device uses algorithms to perform its functions in the form of hardware- or software-based routines. <br>
                
                In finance, algorithms have become important in developing automated and high-frequency trading (HFT) systems, <br>
                as well as in the pricing of sophisticated financial instruments like derivatives. <br><br><br>
                
                <p class="para">KEY TAKEAWAYS</p><br>
                An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. <br>
                Every computerized device uses algorithms, which cut the time required to do things manually. <br>
                Algorithmic trading, also known as automated trading or black-box trading, uses a computer program <br>
                to buy or sell securities at a pace not possible for humans. <br><br>
                Algorithmic trading accounts for over 60% of all trading volume in the global equities markets. <br>
                Algorithmic traders can analyze information faster than humans, allowing them to respond instantly <br>
                to minute price movements.Understanding Algorithms Financial companies use algorithms in areas <br>
                such as loan pricing, stock trading, asset-liability management, and many automated functions. <br>
                For example, algorithmic trading, known as algo trading, is used for deciding the timing, pricing, <br>
                and quantity of stock orders. Also referred to as automated trading or black-box trading, algo <br>
                trading uses computer programs to buy or sell securities at a pace not possible for humans. <br>
                
                A large part of stock trading in the U.S. is done using algorithms, and they are also used <br>
                widely in forex trading. A big part of that is high-frequency trading (HFT), often employed by hedge funds. <br>
                
                HFT involves using sophisticated computers and algorithms for trading. One side effect of algos is that the average <br>
                holding period for stocks has decreased significantly—from eight years in the 1950s to less than six months in 2020. <br>
                Computer algorithms make life easier by trimming the time it takes to manually do things. In the world of automation, <br>
                algorithms allow workers to be more proficient and focused. Algorithms make slow processes more proficient. <br>
                In many cases, especially in automation, algos can save companies money. <br><br><br></p>

                <p> <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents. <br>
                    These pages contain information on how to learn and use CSS and on available software. <br>
                    CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular <br>
                    elements or groups of elements on your web page. In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. <br>
                    This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. <br><br>
                    The CSS selectors module defines the patterns to select elements to which a set of CSS rules are then <br>
                    applied along with their specificity . The CSS selectors module provides us with more than 60 selectors and <br>
                    five combinators. Other modules provide additional pseudo-class selectors and pseudo-elements.<br><br>

                    <p class="para"></p>What are the 2 main parts of a CSS syntax?</p><br>
                    A CSS rule consists of two main parts: selector ('h1') and declaration ('color: red'). In HTML, element names <br>
                    are case-insensitive so 'h1' works just as well as 'H1'. The declaration has two parts: property name ('color') <br>
                    and property value ('red'). <br><br>

                        At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components: Properties: These are human-readable <br>
                        identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. <br>
                        For example, font-size , width , background-color . Values: Each property is assigned a value. <br><br><br>

                            <p><h3>what is data science?</h3>
                                Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary <br>
                                approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, <br>
                                artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. <br>
                                What is data science used for? <br>
                                Data science is used to study data in four main ways: <br>

                                1. Descriptive analysis <br>
                                Descriptive analysis examines data to gain insights into what happened or what is happening in the data environment. <br>
                                It is characterized by data visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives. <br>
                                For example, a flight booking service may record data like the number of tickets booked each day. <br>
                                Descriptive analysis will reveal booking spikes, booking slumps, and high-performing months for this service. <br>
                                
                                2. Diagnostic analysis <br>
                                Diagnostic analysis is a deep-dive or detailed data examination to understand why something happened. <br>
                                It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations. <br>
                                Multiple data operations and transformations may be performed on a given data set to discover <br>
                                unique patterns in each of these techniques.For example, the flight service might drill down on a particularly <br>
                                high-performing month to better understand the booking spike. This may lead to the discovery that many customers <br>
                                visit a particular city to attend a monthly sporting event. <br>
                                
                                3. Predictive analysis <br>
                                Predictive analysis uses historical data to make accurate forecasts about data patterns that may occur in the future. <br>
                                It is characterized by techniques such as machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. <br>
                                In each of these techniques, computers are trained to reverse engineer causality connections in the data.For example, <br>
                                the flight service team might use data science to predict flight booking patterns for the coming year at the start of each year. <br>
                                The computer program or algorithm may look at past data and predict booking spikes for certain destinations in May. <br>
                                Having anticipated their customer’s future travel requirements, the company could start targeted advertising from February. <br>
                                
                                4. Prescriptive analysis <br>
                                Prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next level. It not only predicts what is likely to happen but also suggests <br>
                                an optimum response to that outcome. It can analyze the potential implications of different choices and recommend the best course of action. <br>
                                It uses graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and recommendation engines from machine learning. <br><br><br><br>

                            <p><h3>what is HTML?</h3> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be <br>
                            structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. <br>
                            HTML is not a programming language. It's a markup language. In fact, that is the technology's name: HyperText Markup Language. <br>
                            There are three categories of HTML: transitional, strict, and frameset. Transitional is the most common type of HTML while the strict <br>
                            type of HTML is meant to return rules to HTML and make it more reliable. Frameset allows Web developers to create a mosaic <br>
                            of HTML documents and a menu system. <br>
                            The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. <br>
                            The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999. Another version, <br>
                            XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. <br>
                            What are the 4 basic HTML tags? <br>
                            Basic HTML Tags There is a range of HTML tags, they help you to design your web page. There are four required tags in HTML. <br>
                            These are html, title, head and body. <br> <br></p>

                            <p><h3>why use java?</h3>The name JAVA is a computer-based programming language that functions to develop computer-based applications. <br>
                            It does not have a specific full form or neither an abbreviation. Hence, the 'Just Another Virtual Accelerator' <br>
                            is a fictionalized complete version of JAVA and the name is put forward by the general public. <br>
                            Tasks commonly performed with Java <br>
                            <li>Building and running mobile applications.</li>
                            <li>Building and scaling cloud applications.</li>

                            <li>Supporting artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) devices.</li><br>
                            A Java program may conation more than one class definition. We use the class keyword to define the class. The class is a <br>
                            blueprint of a Java program. It contains information about user-defined methods, variables, and constants. <br>
                            Every Java program has at least one class that contains the main() method. <br>
                            Data Structure in java is defined as the collection of data pieces that offers an effective means of storing and <br>
                            organising data in a computer. Linked List, Stack, Queue, and arrays are a few examples of java data structures. <br><br><br></p>

                                JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the <br>
                                behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. <br>
                                It is one of the most versatile languages for building rich and dynamic websites. JavaScript is typically used for <br>
                                front-end web development, but it can also be used for backend development. <br>
                                JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. <br>
                                After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. <br>
                                In order to start coding in JavaScript the next step is to open up the actual place where we will write and execute the code <br>
                                inside the Chrome browser. From the top menu, Go to: Menu, then Developer, and then click on JavaScript Console. You can also <br>
                                use the shortcut for Mac, which is “option + command + J”. <br>

                                    An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, <br>
                                    manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the <br>
                                    operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API). <br>
                                    The following are the two types of Operating System along with their examples. <br>
                                    Single-User Operating System for example, DOS, Windows 95/97. <br>
                                    Multi-User Operating System for example, UNIX, LINUX <br>
                                    What is an Operating System Used for? <br>
                                    The operating system helps in improving the computer software as well as hardware. Without OS, it became very <br>
                                    difficult for any application to be user-friendly. The Operating System provides a user with an interface that <br>
                                    makes any application attractive and user-friendly. The operating System comes with a large number of device <br>
                                    drivers that make OS services reachable to the hardware environment. Each and every application present in the <br>
                                    system requires the Operating System. The operating system works as a communication channel between <br>
                                    system hardware and system software. The operating system helps an application with the hardware part without <br>
                                    knowing about the actual hardware configuration. It is one of the most important parts of the system and hence <br>
                                    it is present in every device, whether large or small device <br>

                                        Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. <br>
                                        Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as accountants and <br>

                                            The UI/UX Design Specialization brings a design-centric approach to user interface and user experience design, <br>
                                            offers practical, skill-based instruction centered around a visual communications perspective, rather than on <br>
                                            one focused on marketing or programming alone. <br>
                                            The answer is no. UI/UX design is one among numerous non-technical roles in tech that doesn't require any <br>
                                            coding or programming skills. However, having previous experience in coding or programming skills is beneficial as <br>
                                            communicating with developers is made easier. <br>
                                            HTML defines the structure and content of the web page, CSS controls the layout and style, and JavaScript adds <br>
                                            interactivity and logic. You can use various libraries and frameworks based on these technologies to enhance your <br>
                                            UI and UX design, such as Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, and Vue. <br>
                                            Learn about the differences between UI and UX (and which might be a better career for you). <br>
                                            User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are two words that you might hear mentioned <br>
                                            frequently in tech circles (and sometimes interchangeably). <br>
                                            UX design stands for user experience design, while UI design stands for user interface design. <br>
                                            Both are important facets of the custom software development process, and both involve working <br>
                                            closely with users to create interfaces that are both effective and easy to use. <br>
                                            Designing the user interface (UI) and the user experience (UX) has grown in importance in creating new products. <br>
                                            In addition, the requirement for user-centered, intuitive, and seamless designs has increased in importance as <br>
                                            technology continues to evolve rapidly. In short, the future of UI/UX designer is quite bright. <br>
                                            UX design focuses on creating a seamless and meaningful user experience by understanding user needs, <br>
                                            conducting research, and designing intuitive interfaces, while UI design focuses on the visual, <br>
                                            interactive elements of a product to create aesthetically-pleasing interfaces. <br>
                                            UI UX designers create the user interface for an app, website, or other interactive media. <br>
                                            Their work includes collaborating with product managers and engineers to gather requirements <br>
                                            from users before designing ideas that can be communicated using storyboards. <br><br><br><br></p>
